   n_sessions
      The number of total sessions.

   n_states

   state mixing
      Refers to whether the model is capable of capturing within-session state modulations, rather than assigning the entire sessions (or the largest part of them) to a single state. For more information, visit Ahrends et al. (2022) article `here <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35217207/>`_.
